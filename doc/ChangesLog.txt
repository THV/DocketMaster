   released version 1.0.10 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: I added the islastweek function in the datetools.c file and the prototype in the datetools.h file.
        -Updated: I started working on the isholiday function, but have commented it out for the moment.
        -Added: Several new #defines in the datetools.h and ruleprocessor.h files to deal with "magic" numbers for weeks and other codes.
        -Applied: I re-opened the datetools.c file for compliation.

02 October 2011
   released version 1.0.9 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: Implemented extern variable declaration/definition re struct holidaynode *holidaylist[12];

25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.8 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: In ruleprocessor.h struct holidaynode *holidaylist[12] was declared as extern, and the code would not compile.  I commented it out and left a note to research the 'extern" issue.

25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.7 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: Commented the parseholidays() function to recognize the issue with subtracing one from the month when calling the addholidayrule() function.
 
25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.5 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: printholidayrules() function to the rule processing module so I could test whether the array of linked lists was working.  It appears to be working fine.

24 September 2011
   released version 1.0.3 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: modified insertions into array of linked lists for holiday rules. Two fixes.  First #define MONTHS was increased from 12 to 13 (to accommodate the code for "all months").  Second the call to the addholidayrule() function was updated to subtract one from the rule that was read in.  The rules file recognizes months counting from 1 to 13.  The array counts from 0 to 12.  I am considering a more elegant way to deal with this issue.


24 September 2011
   released version 1.0.1 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Updated: Changed from binary tree data type to array of linked lists for holiday rules.
