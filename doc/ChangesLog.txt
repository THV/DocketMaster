20 October 2011
   released version 1.0.19 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Updated: I Changed the name holidaylist to the name holidayhashtable.  This is, after all, a chained hash table. The hash function corresponds to the months of the year.

09 October 2011
   released version 1.0.18 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -New: coded and partially tested the courtday_difference function.

09 October 2011
   released version 1.0.17 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -New: Revised and updated program documentation and comments

08 October 2011
   released version 1.0.16 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: New datetools testing functions in main: holidayprinttest() and testsuite_checkholidays().
        -Fixed: Was having problems in processing weekend and relative rules.  The problem was the datetime struct datatypes for wkday and wknum were chars.  I converted them to int and added a step in parseholidays() to convert an ASCII string read from ascii the holiday file to a decimal number using a paramaterized macro ASCII2DECIMAL().
        -New: I fully debugged the isholiday() function
        -Added: added the courtday_offset function.
        -Added: test function in main to test the courtday_offset function.

07 October 2011
   released version 1.0.14 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -New: Created a new rule processing engine called processhrule.  This function does the hardwork of comparing a date to a rule to see if the date falls on a holiday defined by the rule.
        -Cleaned: Streamlined the isholiday() function by separating out the processing engine.

06 October 2011
   released version 1.0.14 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: In datetools.h, I added two arrays montharray, which lists the month numbers.  The other array is daysinmonths, which is a 2dimensional array that lists the total days for each month including leap years.

06 October 2011
   released version 1.0.13 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: testsuite_dates routine in main to test various date functions.
        -Fixed: new function in datetools.c called islastxdom() -- to calculate whether a date is the last Xday of the month.
        -Added: The islastweek() function was not working correctly.  That function was renamed islastxdom.  The problem with islastweek is that it was a confused function.  It was trying to tell us whther a certain day was the last X day (e.g., Tuesday) of the month, but it was programmed as if it were telling us whether some date was in the last week.  I copied the function into a new islastweek, but that function is not coded yet.  It's job will be to tell us if a date is in the last week of the month.
        -Added: isleapyear function

05 October 2011
   released version 1.0.10 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: I added the islastweek function in the datetools.c file and the prototype in the datetools.h file.
        -Updated: I started working on the isholiday function, but have commented it out for the moment.
        -Added: Several new #defines in the datetools.h and ruleprocessor.h files to deal with "magic" numbers for weeks and other codes.
        -Applied: I re-opened the datetools.c file for compliation.

02 October 2011
   released version 1.0.9 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: Implemented extern variable declaration/definition re struct holidaynode *holidaylist[12];

25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.8 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: In ruleprocessor.h struct holidaynode *holidaylist[12] was declared as extern, and the code would not compile.  I commented it out and left a note to research the 'extern" issue.

25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.7 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: Commented the parseholidays() function to recognize the issue with subtracing one from the month when calling the addholidayrule() function.
 
25 September 2011
   released version 1.0.5 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: printholidayrules() function to the rule processing module so I could test whether the array of linked lists was working.  It appears to be working fine.

24 September 2011
   released version 1.0.3 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Fixed: modified insertions into array of linked lists for holiday rules. Two fixes.  First #define MONTHS was increased from 12 to 13 (to accommodate the code for "all months").  Second the call to the addholidayrule() function was updated to subtract one from the rule that was read in.  The rules file recognizes months counting from 1 to 13.  The array counts from 0 to 12.  I am considering a more elegant way to deal with this issue.


24 September 2011
   released version 1.0.1 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Updated: Changed from binary tree data type to array of linked lists for holiday rules.
